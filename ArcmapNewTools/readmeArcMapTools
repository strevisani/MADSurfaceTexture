Here you will find new developed arcmap tools related to roughness calculation.

Currently you will find a first toolbox "Mad2cV1" permitting to calculate some basic surface/image texture indices for a lag of 2 pixels

I will add new staff in the coming weeks...



A really important thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Arcmap has some trickeries (at least on window systems) in managing the international settings (i.e., comma or point as decimal separator). The
code uses custom weigth kernels that use the point as decimal separator. I suggest to set in international setting as English (US) and 
the point as decimal separator. If you get an error message "invalid weight neighborhood mask" is related to this issue.
