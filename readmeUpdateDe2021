This is a quick update to comunicate that in the following weeks I'll upload new code related to geostatistical based indices
for surface/image texture analysis.

I will do some minor updates for the version in phyton for arcmap/arcgis pro. In this environments I'm adding a new simplified toolbox and a function for computing
vector ruggedness (i.e., dispersion of vector normals to surface).

However, the main change is related to the new cose for R environment, using the facilities of Terra package.

Regarding the kernels, these will be updated using more significative digits.
