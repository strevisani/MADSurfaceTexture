The software for geostatistical-based surface rougness (or even image texture) analysis has been updated taking into account the simplified approach
based on differences of order 2, permitting to bypass the detrending step and to compute interesting short-range roughness indexes in one click (the only
choice is the size of the search window). 
For more information look at Trevisani, S, Teza, G. and Guth, P., A Simplified Geostatistical Approach for Characterizing Key Aspects of Short-Range Roughness. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4223135 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4223135

In the folder "RImplementation" you will find the implementation via R functions (using the "terra" package), probably further development will be in this language.

In the folder "ArcMapNewTools" you will find new kernels of order 2 and a couple of toolbooxes for computing short-range roughness indexes directly from the DEM. Clearly,
you can use the new kernels using the conventional scripts in phyton for arcmap. In the toolbox "Mad1ck2" the version V3 of the library has been adopted.
